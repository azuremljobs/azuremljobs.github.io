      <h2><strong>R for Enterprise Advanced Analytics (REAA) Team</strong></h2>
      <p>Our mission is to empower enterprises to easily and cost-effectively build high-scale analytics solutions leveraging R.</p>
      <p>Exponential growth has transformed data into a new natural resource. Every industry has focused on exploiting data analytics for competitive advantage. Business applications of advanced analytics abound: consumer companies doing targeted marketing, financial firms scoring customer credit-worthiness, retailers managing product promotions, manufacturers detecting anomalies in sensor data, & many more.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, R is an open source programming language & environment for statistical computing. More importantly, R is an innovation engine, with applications that run the gamut from quantitative finance to bioinformatics to machine learning. Over the past several years, R has enjoyed tremendous growth in usage & mindshare in the data science community, reaching a user count in the millions.</p>
      <p>Within the Information Management & Machine Learning (IMML) organization, we are forming this new team around the Revolution Analytics acquisition to drive the future of R as a tool for enterprise advanced analytics. To achieve this, we are going to make the Microsoft platform a great place to operationalize R analytics workloads, both on-prem and in the cloud. We will democratize the process of deploying R code as production cloud services. We will enable the use of R within compelling in-database analytics scenarios. We will further accelerate & scale R analytics workloads by integrating with modern big data processing frameworks. And we will invest in the open-source R ecosystem in ways that help foster its evolution and add value to the data science community.</p>
      <p>We're seeking strong highly motivated software engineers, program managers, & software engineering leads to join us on this journey. Please browse the job descriptions below for details.</p>
