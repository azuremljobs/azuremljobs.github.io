      <h2><a id="RevolutionR"></a><strong>Revolution R Product Team</strong></h2>
      <p>Our mission is to empower enterprises to easily and cost-effectively build high-scale analytics solutions leveraging R.</p>
      <p>Exponential growth has transformed data into a new natural resource. Every industry has focused on exploiting data analytics for competitive advantage. Business applications of advanced analytics abound: consumer companies doing targeted marketing, financial firms scoring customer credit-worthiness, retailers managing product promotions, manufacturers detecting anomalies in sensor data, & many more.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, R is an open source programming language &amp; environment for statistical computing. More importantly, R is an innovation engine, with applications that run the gamut from quantitative finance to bioinformatics to machine learning. Over the past several years, R has enjoyed tremendous growth in usage &amp; mindshare in the data science community, reaching a user count in the millions.</p>
      <p>Within the Information Management &amp; Machine Learning (IMML) organization, we are forming this new team around the Revolution Analytics acquisition to drive the future of R as a tool for enterprise advanced analytics. To achieve this, we are going to make the Microsoft platform a great place to operationalize R analytics workloads, both on-prem and in the cloud. We will democratize the process of deploying R code as production cloud services. We will enable the use of R within compelling in-database analytics scenarios. We will further accelerate & scale R analytics workloads by integrating with modern big data processing frameworks. And we will invest in the open-source R ecosystem in ways that help foster its evolution and add value to the data science community.</p>
      <p>We're seeking strong highly motivated software engineers, program managers, &amp; software engineering leads to join us on this journey. Please browse the job descriptions below for details.</p>

      <p>Want to join the team that is behind the <a href="http://how-old.net/" target="_blank">#HowOldRobot</a> internet phenomena? Want to feel like you’re working in the coolest startup, but with the potential of getting the service you built to scale out to 10s of 1000s transactions per second? Come join the Azure Machine Learning Marketplace Team.</p>
      <p>Our vision is to create a marketplace for intelligent web services on top of the Azure ML platform, that will provide immediate business value for our customers by offering them machine learning and predictive analytics solutions on the cloud that solve their business problems.</p>
      <p>The Azure Machine Learning Marketplace is a place that connects providers (data scientists and machine learning / predictive analytics experts) and consumers (developers, information workers and business decision makers). In addition to the Marketplace infrastructure, we also build high value services that will be offered through the Marketplace. For example – check out the <a href="http://how-old.net/" target="_blank">#HowOldRobot</a> website, built using the <a href="http://gallery.azureml.net/MachineLearningAPI/b0b2598aa46c4f44a08af8891e415cc7" target="_blank">FaceAPI</a> from the <a href="http://gallery.azureml.net" target="_blank">Azure ML Gallery</a>.</p>
      <p>We are looking for talented software engineers who are passionate about customers, and want to design and build highly available, scalable machine learning services. We are looking for people who are proactive, results-oriented and have the ability to work with minimal ongoing direction.</p>
