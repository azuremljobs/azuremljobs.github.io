                <p>Our mission is to empower enterprises to easily and cost-effectively build
                    high-scale analytics solutions leveraging R.</p>

                <p>Exponential growth has transformed data into a new natural resource. Every
                    industry has focused on exploiting data analytics for competitive advantage.
                    Business applications of advanced analytics abound: consumer companies doing
                    targeted marketing, financial firms scoring customer credit-worthiness, retailers
                    managing product promotions, manufacturers detecting anomalies in sensor
                    data, &amp; many more. <a class="read-more collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#RevolutionRCollapsed">Read

                <div class="collapse" id="RevolutionRCollapsed">
                    <p>For the uninitiated, R is an open source programming language &amp; environment
                        for statistical computing. More importantly, R is an innovation engine, with
                        applications that run the gamut from quantitative finance to bioinformatics
                        to machine learning. Over the past several years, R has enjoyed tremendous
                        growth in usage &amp; mindshare in the data science community, reaching a
                        user count in the millions.</p>

                    <p>Within the Information Management &amp; Machine Learning (IMML) organization,
                        we are forming this new team around the Revolution Analytics acquisition
                        to drive the future of R as a tool for enterprise advanced analytics. To
                        achieve this, we are going to make the Microsoft platform a great place to
                        operationalize R analytics workloads, both on-prem and in the cloud. We will
                        democratize the process of deploying R code as production cloud services.
                        We will enable the use of R within compelling in-database analytics scenarios.
                        We will further accelerate &amp; scale R analytics workloads by integrating with
                        modern big data processing frameworks. And we will invest in the open-source
                        R ecosystem in ways that help foster its evolution and add value to the data
                        science community.</p>
