                <h2><strong>Revolution R Product Team</strong></h2>

                <p>Our mission is to empower enterprises to easily and cost-effectively build
                    high-scale analytics solutions leveraging R.</p>

                <p>Exponential growth has transformed data into a new natural resource. Every
                    industry has focused on exploiting data analytics for competitive advantage.
                    Business applications of advanced analytics abound: consumer companies doing
                    targeted marketing, financial firms scoring customer credit-worthiness, retailers
                    managing product promotions, manufacturers detecting anomalies in sensor
                    data, & many more.</p>

                <p>For the uninitiated, R is an open source programming language &amp; environment
                    for statistical computing. More importantly, R is an innovation engine, with
                    applications that run the gamut from quantitative finance to bioinformatics
                    to machine learning. Over the past several years, R has enjoyed tremendous
                    growth in usage &amp; mindshare in the data science community, reaching a
                    user count in the millions.</p>

                <p>Within the Information Management &amp; Machine Learning (IMML) organization,
                    we are forming this new team around the Revolution Analytics acquisition
                    to drive the future of R as a tool for enterprise advanced analytics. To
                    achieve this, we are going to make the Microsoft platform a great place to
                    operationalize R analytics workloads, both on-prem and in the cloud. We will
                    democratize the process of deploying R code as production cloud services.
                    We will enable the use of R within compelling in-database analytics scenarios.
                    We will further accelerate & scale R analytics workloads by integrating with
                    modern big data processing frameworks. And we will invest in the open-source
                    R ecosystem in ways that help foster its evolution and add value to the data
                    science community.</p>

                <p>We're seeking strong highly motivated software engineers, program managers,
                    &amp; software engineering leads to join us on this journey. Please browse

                    <p>Our vision is to create a marketplace for intelligent web services on top of

                    <p>The Azure Machine Learning Marketplace is a place that connects providers (data
                        scientists and machine learning / predictive analytics experts) and consumers
                        (developers, information workers and business decision makers). In addition
                        to the Marketplace infrastructure, we also build high value services that

                <h2><strong>Azure ML Platform Services</strong></h2>

                <p>Amount of data around us is growing exponentially and "Big Data" is becoming
                    mainstream in the computing industry. Traditional data analysis tools are
                    no longer sufficient to draw insights from Terabytes and Petabytes of data.
                    We are the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning team - a fast paced team with
                    a startup mindset within Microsoft Cloud + Enterprise organization.</p>

                <p>We are building an exciting Machine Learning platform that makes it very easy
                    to create ML experiments and deploy robust, reliable, scalable and highly
                    available ML applications on the cloud.</p>

                <p>We are looking for an experienced Software Engineer who is passionate about
                    designing and building highly available, reliable, secure and elastic cloud
                    platform. You will have an opportunity to take highly scientific and leading
                    edge machine learning concepts and make them accessible as an everyday tool
                    for designing ML experiments, run them on massive amounts of data and visualize
                    the results in intuitive ways. You should have a proven track record of having
                    designed and delivered distributed systems optimized for Cloud. A strong
                    working mindset on improving fundamentals for Azure Services like high-availability,
                    disaster recovery, deployment, alerting, monitoring, metrics and live site
                    is a must. You should be able to work comfortably in a fast-paced V1 environment
                    where requirements change dynamically.</p>
